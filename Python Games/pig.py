Two players take turns; on each turn, a player rolls a six-sided die as many times as she wishes, or until she rolls a 6.\nEach number she rolls, except a 6, is added to her score this turn; but if she rolls a 6, her score for this turn is zero, and her turn ends.\nAt the end of each turn, the score for that turn is added to the player's total score. The first player to reach or exceed 50 wins.\n\nFor example:\n\tAlice rolls 3, 5, 3, 1, and stops. Her score is now 12.\n\tBob rolls 5, 4, 1, 1, 2, and stops. His score is now 13.\n\tAlice rolls 5, 3, 3, 5, 4, and stops. Her score is now 32 (12 + 20).\n\tBob rolls 4, 6. He has to stop, and his score is still 13 (13 + 0).\n\tetc.\n\nTo make the game  fair, if the first player reaches or exceeds 50, the second player gets one additional turn. However, if the second player is the first to reach 50, the first player does not get an additional turn.\nYou will play against the computer. The computer always goes first, so you get one more turn if the computer is the first to reach 50.\nIf both players are tied with 50 or more, each gets another turn until the tie is broken. Each player must roll the die at least once per turn.")
